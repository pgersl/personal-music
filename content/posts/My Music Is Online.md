I finally brought myself to doing this. My Compositions have been shared between my friends for more than two years and it is finally time to post them somewhere online. Welcome to the start of a journey! A lot is here and more is yet to come!

# My First Collection of Music Online!

The collection of my oldest pieces is finally here for the whole internet to listen to. My pieces are available on [audio.com](https://audio.com/petr-gersl), [Bandcamp](https://pgersl.bandcamp.com/) and also for future Patrons on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/user?u=98919388). It is called [Ger≈°l: Works for Piano](/discography/works-for-piano), and it includes my first 15 Compositions for piano and my own Piano Sonata No. 1. You can listen to these and learn more about them [even here](/compositions/)!

# More Is Coming, Hopefully Soon!

This is not where it ends now. I still have more than 10 hours of music to post online. My uploading schedule will not be consistent in the next few weeks, but to give you an idea of what is coming, I will share the next collections I am working on right now! Still not sure about all the names, but just to give you a hint:

- **Works for Piano II** - a collection of my remaining pieces for solo piano
- **Couterpointing** - a cycle of highly reductionistic pieces, inspired by Steve Reich
- **Counterpoints I** and **II** - pieces for chamber ensembles 
- **Grindset** - pieces for those who need repetition while working
- and more!

# Plans Are Huge!

I am currently working on releasing my music on Spotify, Youtube and some other platforms with more active users. I am also working on the scores for my music so that it can be reproduced. We'll see where this all goes, stay tuned for further announcements!
