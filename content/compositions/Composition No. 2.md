*Composition No. 2* is my second work. It has been written very shortly after [Composition No. 1](/compositions/composition-no.-1) and continues in a highly reductionistic style with patterns and figures derived from the music of Philip Glass.

# Analysis

Composition No. 2 can be divided into three sections: introduction, development and Coda. Coda is a simple variation on the introduction which slowly fades out as the last chord is played. The development section is based on a simple weak chord progression: I - iii - &#9837;III (in relation to the current key center) or II - &#9839;iv - IV (in relation to the next key center). The melody is in triplets throughout the piece arpeggiating chords and the accompaniment is just chords. After the development section is played, a small part of the introduction is repeated and Coda is played afterward.
