*Composition No. 1* is my first ever written down and preserved piece. It is short, only 57 seconds in length. It was written in the summer of 2021 and marked the beginning of a long compositional journey.

# Analysis

Composition No. 1 is composed of two sections and a single-chord coda. Each section repeats twice. After the second repetition of the second section, the final chord is played. The harmonies of the two sections are rather unusual based on primarily major 7th chords and sus chords. The tonality of the piece is rather modern, the key is marked as G major (one #).

# Rewrites

The rewriting or scrapping of Composition No. 1 was considered many times, certainly after much longer pieces were written. However,  I never rewrote it. The piece is in its original state still today.

The main reason for this decision is the goal of preserving my older style to see my growth as a composer. Listening to the piece today is similar to looking into the past and experiencing again the childish pride of writing something unique that could have my name on it. Even in those 57 seconds, I can hear it.
