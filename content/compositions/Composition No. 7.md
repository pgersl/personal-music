*Composition No. 7* is a highly reductionistic piece only based on two chords. Despite that, it shows some inventiveness and dynamic diversity.

# Analysis

Composition No. 7 is divided into 9 sections and a coda. The harmony of the piece is quite simple only alternating between two chords - F<sup>m7</sup> and E<sup>maj7</sup> (marked F&#9837;<sup>maj7</sup>). It is another example of a common tone modulation, this time, the chords contain two common tones - A&#9837; and E&#9837;. The nine sections are full of different patterns of arpeggios of these chords.
