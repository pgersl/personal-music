*Composition No. 4* is a highly reductionistic variation on Glass' Ã‰tude No. 11.

# Analysis

Composition No. 4 is based on a simple harmonic movement in C minor, usually not going far from the tonic, mostly just the movement of upper extensions of the tonic. The tempo changes only a few times throughout the piece.
