# Analysis

Composition No. 19 has two primary inspiration sources. The first one and the most influential one is a piece I heard at a Brno Philharmonic concert of Cello Octet Amsterdam and Maki Namekawa (piano). The piece was called *Undulated Waters*. It starts very calm and grows in energy over time. The second is some pieces by Joe Hisaishi, I used an entire figure from one of his pieces in this composition.

The piece is very repetitive devided into many small chunks ending with a short modern waltz. The harmony of the piece is very simple based on a B&#9837;<sup>maj7</sup> chord.
