*Composition No. 9* is a highly reductionistic piece and is one of the last of my piano compositions to be written this way. 

# Analysis

Composition No. 9 is written in two parts, which do almost sound like two different compositions and the transition between these parts is not smooth but sudden. I do not remember exactly why I wanted the piece to sound like this, however, similar to many of my pieces for piano, it was a product of improvisation. The idea was organic and I naturally went for this sudden change.

The harmony of Composition No. 9 is not traditionally tonal. It 
again employs some common-tone chord progressions (e.g. I - iii - &#9837;III). The chord progression in the first part is centered around E&#9837; major, however, this chord is never played and is only present in upper extensions. The chord progression actually looks like this: ii<sup>m11</sup> (it could also be written as a polychord of I/II) - v (notated &#x1D12A;iii) - &#9837;VII<sup>6</sup> (notated &#9839;VI<sup>6</sup>) - VII<sup>dim</sup> - V.

The melody is practically non-existent.

# Rewrites

Composition No. 9 was never rewritten or modified, although, it was considered several times. After a certain amount of time between the composition and the present, I grew fond of the sudden change in mood, harmony and tempo. I do not think I will be rewriting this piece.
