# Analysis

Compoistion No. 24 is by far the longest of my solo piano compositions. It is very repetitive and it's main idea is the gradual process of change. You can quite clearly hear it as you listen through the piece. The harmony of this piece is almost unchanging and only switches between two chords - E&#9837; and A&#9837;. The individual sections of the piece are separated by calmer parts, whereas the sections themselves are dynamically more active, and faster in tempo.
