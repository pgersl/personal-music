Your support is greatly appreciated. If you do find my music interesting and worthwhile, you can show your support via different means.

# Listening {{< icon-link href="https://audio.com/petr-gersl" target="_blank" icon="fa-solid fa-record-vinyl" >}}

By simply listening to my music, you are fulfilling its purpose. Otherwise, what is the purpose of music nobody listens to?

# Sharing

By sharing my music anywhere you think is appropriate, you are getting my name out there and giving me countless opportunities for further compositional development. Thank you!

# Purchasing {{< icon-link href="https://pgersl.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" icon="fa-brands fa-bandcamp" >}}

You can support me financially by purchasing my music on Bandcamp. You can find all my tracks there (exported from Musescore) and support me and Bandcamp by buying them. This way you not only help me grow my financial independence, but you are also supporting a platform for creators like me and many others. Thank you very much!

# Patreon {{< icon-link href="https://patreon.com/user?u=98919388" target="_blank" icon="fa-brands fa-patreon" >}}

You can support me financially by subscribing to my Patreon. There are several three subscriptions for you to choose from:

1. The first subscription ($5/month) is only a means of support, you get no special content by subscribing, but you help me gain financial independence and support the platform that enables creators like me to start and get in touch with their appreciators. 
2. The second subscription ($9/month) gives you access to all my audio files in the highest quality and sheet music for selected works. You might also get new compositions earlier than they get published.
3. The third subscription ($18/month) gives you access to all my audio files in the highest quality and scores to all my works. You will also gain access to Musescore files. You will also get new compositions earlier than they get published anywhere else. I might also include a more direct way to contact me.

Support through any subscription is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

# Donating {{< icon-link href="https://paypal.me/petrgersl" target="_blank" icon="fa-brands fa-paypal" >}}

If you only want to support me financially, you may do so through personal donations using your PayPal account. Donations of any size are greatly appreciated.
