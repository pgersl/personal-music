# Program note

Piano Counterpoint No. 6 is probably the last piano counterpoint I will ever write. It is the longest of all the six piano counterpoints. It is once again based on the music of David Borden, just longer.

The piece is divided into three parts. Each section builds and abruptly stops to leave only piano 1 playing. The piece ends on a dissonant harmonic progression and much more aggressively.
