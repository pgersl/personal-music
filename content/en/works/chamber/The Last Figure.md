# Program note

*The Last Figure* is my heartfelt farewell to the compositional style of Philip Glass. For years, his music has been a cornerstone of my creative journey. Through its hypnotic minimalism, repetitive structures, and gradual evolution of motifs, Glass’s style has profoundly influenced my work. Over time, I have composed more than 20 piano pieces, several chamber works, and even a symphony in his distinctive style. However, every journey must have its turning point. With *The Last Figure*, I am finally ready to bid farewell to this chapter and explore new directions as a composer.

The inspiration behind *The Last Figure* is deeply personal. It pays homage to one of my all-time favorite compositions by Glass, *The Grid* from the groundbreaking film *Koyaanisqatsi*. For me, *The Grid* is a masterpiece of energy and motion—a vivid portrayal of the relentless pace of urban life. This piece became a soundtrack to my imagination, a musical embodiment of a city awakening, brimming with life, chaos, and purpose. When I set out to compose *The Last Figure*, I knew I wanted to channel that same dynamism—to capture the pulse of a city coming alive.

The journey to compose this piece began with a persistent harmonic motif. It was a phrase that haunted me, demanding to be written. For weeks, it echoed in my mind, weaving itself into my thoughts. At first, I envisioned the piece as a dance for organ, inspired by Glass’s *Dance No. 4*. The organ’s powerful and resonant timbre seemed perfect for the intensity I imagined. But as I developed the idea further, it became clear that the motif demanded a broader palette. An ensemble offered the flexibility and depth I needed to bring the piece to life.

Working on The Last Figure was both a challenge and a revelation. While I drew on the techniques and structures I had learned from studying Glass’s work, I also began to recognize the importance of stepping away from his shadow. I believe I have refined and mastered the style of the Philip Glass pieces I admire most. However, in striving to create the perfect replica of his work, I realized that I had lost a sense of my own voice in my compositions.

As I reflect on this piece, I feel a profound sense of closure. Philip Glass’s influence on my music has been immense, and I will always cherish the lessons I’ve learned from his style. But with The Last Figure, I’ve realized it’s time to move forward. I’m excited to embrace the unknown, to experiment, and to create works that feel uniquely mine. This piece marks the end of one chapter and the beginning of another—a journey into uncharted territory where my own voice can truly emerge.

I’m eager to see where this new path will lead. The possibilities are limitless, and I’m filled with anticipation for the stories and sounds that await. The Last Figure is not just a farewell—it is also a celebration, a tribute, and, most importantly, a promise to keep evolving as an artist.
