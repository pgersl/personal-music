# Program note

*Glass Cycle* is my official homage to Philip Glass, marking the culmination of years spent creating music inspired by his iconic works. While his compositions may no longer be the ones I listen to most frequently, their influence remains undeniable. They continue to fascinate me–not just for their hypnotic beauty and structural ingenuity but also for how they’ve shaped the language of contemporary music, inspiring generations of composers who now craft breathtakingly innovative pieces.

At its core, *Glass Cycle* is built on my own [Composition No. 25](/works/solo/composition-no.-25), which itself takes inspiration from Glass’s *Closing* from *Mishima*. The piece follows a similar structural logic to some of Glass’s other renowned works, with *Floe* from *Glassworks* and *Mad Rush* coming to mind as touchstones. In this sense, *Glass Cycle* is both a reinterpretation and an exploration—a reflection of how his style can evolve and take on new forms.

Listening to *Glass Cycle* might best be approached as an immersive, ambient experience. It’s a piece I’d personally enjoy as background music while working or reflecting, allowing its layers to blend into the moment. However, for those who choose to concentrate on it, there are subtleties woven into its fabric—hidden details that may only emerge upon deeper listening. It’s in this duality, between simplicity and complexity, that I feel *Glass Cycle* finds its truest expression.
