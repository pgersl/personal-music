# Program note

Counterpointing is the most reductionistic piece I have ever written, quite similar to In C by Terry Riley. It has no movement of harmony and no real melody to speak of. Only a collection of several repeating motives. The ensemble for which it is written is also unusual containing a mix of acoustic and electronic instruments.

The piece was written for me when I needed to focus on my work. The repetitiveness always aided me in getting to a full-focus state and made me productive.

Counterpointing is divided into 5 movements - an opening and 4 variations. Each movement is scored for a different ensemble. Each variation builds on the motives from the Opening.

The piece was never intended to be performed by anyone and frankly, I do not think it really is performable. Either the performers or the audience would quickly grow tired of it. Try listening to it while you work. It helped me, and maybe it can help you too!
