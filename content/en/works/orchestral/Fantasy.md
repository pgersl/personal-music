# Program note

Fantasy is a deeply personal composition of mine. It originated from a piano improvisation, during which I explored harmonies inspired by Rachmaninoff’s Symphony No. 2 and the iconic theme from Casablanca (As Time Goes By). The influences of these works are clearly reflected in the piece.

Initially, I intended for Fantasy to be scored for full orchestra. However, in order to complete it quickly enough for my Christmas album, I chose instead to arrange it for string orchestra with soloists. I may revisit the piece in the future for a full orchestral arrangement, but with new ideas constantly emerging and time being limited, that seems unlikely for now.
