# Program note

*Sturmpolka* is a brisk and playful orchestral polka in the lively tradition of Johann Strauss, yet with a modern twist of drama and flair. Though it lasts under four minutes, it packs a spirited punch—just enough time to sweep the listener into a swirling dance before disappearing like a sudden summer storm.

The piece follows a simple ternary form: an energetic opening section in C♯ minor, a contrasting middle trio in E major, and a return to the original material with a brief, stormy coda. The music balances elegance and turbulence, as if the dancers were caught in a gust of wind—yet never missing a step.

It’s a miniature ballroom tempest, written to dazzle quickly and vanish just as fast.
