# Program note

I’m endlessly fascinated by how art can inspire other art forms. *Bouquet* is a piece born from exactly that kind of cross-pollination — it was inspired by a stunning pencil drawing of a bouquet of flowers, created on dark-toned paper by Michaela Sedláčková. Her style feels wonderfully distinctive, at least to my amateur eye: drawings on colored paper that seem to sing with their own quiet music.

The moment I saw her drawing, I knew I had to have it. So I bought it — and as I looked at it, a melody began to play in my mind. I quickly wrote it down. From there, much like a wildflower growing freely, the composition unfolded organically, blending elements from various styles, with a strong leaning toward jazz and swing influences.

Structurally, the piece is cyclical in both theme and tempo. It opens slowly with an initial motif, gradually builds momentum into a faster section where the theme is momentarily left behind, then eventually eases back into the original tempo and revisits the opening theme.

One of the main musical inspirations for *Bouquet* comes from the orchestral works of Nikolai Kapustin — an almost forgotten master of classical-jazz fusion, whose brilliance continues to spark creativity in unexpected places.

In the end, *Bouquet* is my tribute to the beauty of creative dialogue between art forms — a conversation between pencil and piano.
