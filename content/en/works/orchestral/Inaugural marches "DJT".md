*Dedicated to Donald J. Trump, 45th and 47th president of the United States of America.*

# Program note

What better way to celebrate a monumental victory in one of the most pivotal elections of our time than with the universal language of music?

I’ve taken three iconic American patriotic songs—including the national anthem—and transformed them into stirring marches, reversing the usual trend of marches being adapted into songs. The pieces I selected are The Star-Spangled Banner, America the Beautiful, and God Bless America. These songs hold a special place in my heart and resonate with me in ways few others do.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest anthems in the world, *The Star-Spangled Banner* is rich in melody, harmony, and interpretive potential. For this arrangement, I aimed to create a classical yet innovative version. It opens with a bold fanfare, transitioning into a march-style introduction, and finally presents the anthem itself—set in a 2/4 time signature instead of the traditional 3/4. The tonal shifts throughout lend a dynamic and evolving character to the piece, making it as versatile as it is profound.

Among patriotic songs worldwide, *America the Beautiful* stands out for its grace and simplicity. Its harmony is straightforward, which inspired me to experiment with a subtle reharmonization—enough to add a fresh perspective while honoring the original’s spirit. This arrangement includes all four verses, allowing it to be sung along to, and is framed by an elegant, smaller fanfare at the beginning. The result is a heartfelt tribute to one of the most beautiful melodies ever written.

Possibly the most beautiful song I’ve ever encountered, *God Bless America* was challenging to reinterpret, given the perfection of its iconic rendition in the film *This is the Army*. For my arrangement, I retained the original harmony and reimagined the piece as a march. Original material is minimal, with the exception of the ending, where I introduced a delicate reharmonization. Here, the march gives way to poignant string solos, presenting the song with emotional depth and bringing it to a reflective conclusion.

*Make America Great Again* is a completely original composition, inspired by the grand British marches of Edward Elgar and William Walton. It follows a traditional Elgarian march structure, incorporating the most extensive instrumentation of all four pieces, including the majestic organ. While not based on any specific song, its main themes feel as though they could be sung, and I encourage any American patriot to craft lyrics for it. Personally, words are not my forte, but the music speaks for itself.

These marches are a deeply personal tribute to a president I admire profoundly—not only for his political achievements but also for his character and business acumen. I see him as a modern-day founding father, someone who inspires hope and determination in countless Americans.

With these marches, I aim to demonstrate that Donald J. Trump is not only a profoundly influential leader for Americans but also an inspiration to people around the world.

Mr. President, these marches are dedicated to you, and you alone.
