# Synopsis

*Tristan and Isolde is a medieval romance about two lovers who fall in love and die tragically. The story of Tristan and Isolde has several versions, a mash-up of which has been used for this symphonic poem.*

Tristan, a heroic figure, serving under his uncle, King Mark of Cornwall, has been bestowed to bring his uncle the most beautiful princess in all of Ireland, Isolde. To do this, he has to sail to Ireland and defeat a dragon who presents a threat to the entire Irish kingdom.

Isolde, a magical princess capable of various acts of wizardry, first resists the notion of being forcefully married to an unknown king, after realizing what Tristan did for her land, however, she agrees to leave and marry King Mark.

On their way back, they drink, accidentally, a love potion intended for Isolde and King Mark, which was given to her by her mother. They fall in love and engage in adultery together, keeping it a secret to not face public scrutiny. Isolde then marries King Mark, as promised by Tristan, and Tristan also marries another woman.

Whilst performing an incredible act of heroism, Tristan is shot by a poisonous arrow, which gets him into a fatal condition. The only person who can save him from certain death is Isolde, for whom he sends a ship and instructs that as the ship arrives back, white flags shall be hung if Isolde is on board, and black flags shall be hung otherwise. His wife, jealous of Transtan's and Isolde's connection, upon seeing a ship with white flags tells Tristan that Isolde has not arrived. He dies after hearing this. Isolde enters the room with Tristan's still-warm body and dies of grief.

To acknowledge their indisputable love, Tristan and Isolde are buried in graves right next to one another. As decades pass, two trees grow from these graves, entangled together as the lovers finally get together in death.

# Program note

## Style

Tristan and Isolde is a large symphonic poem in 9 movements of various lengths, similar to Korzakov's *Scheherezade*, which has 4 movements. The style is meant to resemble Wagner, Bruckner, Mahler, Rachmaninoff and Korngold. The piece strictly follows the synopsis and several repeatedly occurring themes are developed.

Several famous passages of these composers have been quoted or have been modified to only resemble them. The iconic minor ninth from Bruckner's 9th symphony, 3rd movement, is used as a base for the Death theme. Rachmaninoff's theme from King Rostislav is slightly altered to signify Tristan on a ship. A storm in the second movement is based on the opening to the 5th movement of Mahler's 2nd symphony. The calm sea is then represented with a texture very similar to Wagner's opening to *Das Rhinegold*. Some highly romantic or festive passages are inspired heavily by Korngold's film music. A march in the fourth movement is heavily based on the marches by Elgar. The wedding march in the sixth movement uses the same rhythmic pattern as Wagner's *Treulich geführt*. The opening of the seventh movement is heavily based on the opening to Wagner's *Die Walküre*. The funeral in the eighth movement is based on the opening to Tchaikovsky's 6th symphony and Wagner's funeral of Siegfried which then grows to the same harmonies and textures of Bruckner's *Scherzo* of his 9th symphony. A portion of the postlude quotes Mahler's *Adagietto* from his 5th symphony and develops in the same style.

Overall, the piece is late romantic, not with a classical structure, focusing primarily on its themes and motives.

## Themes

The thematic catalog of Tristan and Isolde is relatively large, every few bars are meant to represent something, only a few themes, however, are heard in more than one movement.

## Personal notes

Tristan and Isolde is a vital work for the development of my personal style. During the composition of this piece, I constantly felt weird about using excerpts and parts of large orchestral works which I adore, and I still do. However, I have realized that pursuing a style of music that is so saturated with awesome works of art cannot be easily done since the majority of the best music has already been written. Why not use parts of it to create new works, that, if not on the same level, can at least approach the greatness of these historic works? In the end, I am not ashamed to admit, that a large portion of my work is composed of works already written, rather it makes me proud to be able to connect them in a way that makes sense.
