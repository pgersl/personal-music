# Program note

*Zauberwalzer* is a short, traditional waltz originally derived from a theme in my symphonic poem [Tristan and Isolde](/works/orchestral/tristan-and-isolde). It was initially conceived as the opening movement of a larger suite that would further explore and transform themes from the poem in a lighter, more intimate setting. While the larger project was ultimately abandoned, this waltz survived the process and was completed as a standalone work.

Stylistically, the piece stays close to the character of a classical waltz, but its harmonic language and orchestral color reflect its symphonic origins. The title, *Zauberwalzer* (“Magic Waltz”), was chosen to capture the music’s atmosphere — playful, slightly mysterious, and reminiscent of a fairy-tale world. Rather than telling a concrete story, the piece aims to evoke a sense of enchantment and gentle motion, as if inviting the listener into a fleeting, imagined scene.
