# Program note

*Vox Britannica* is a piece inspired by two of my favorite British composers â€“ Gustav Holst and Edward Elgar, who have both been an inspiration to other pieces of mine. The piece lacks a coherent structure and is more of a succession of musical moments somehow connected together, but I think I sort of made it work.

The work is based on a harmonic progression that haunted me for the past few weeks: C - Ab - F - C# - E. I improvised on it and always came to a different place, including an almost Star Wars like heroic passage or a march, both are included in the final piece.

That what has the strongest impact on me is the serene ending of the Cmaj7add13 chord distributed to different instruments of the orchestra in the last minute followed by a single violin note only to be heard again for the last time.
