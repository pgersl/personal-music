# Program note

Symphony No. 1 is a piece strongly inspired by Glass' *Symphony No. 14 "Lichtenstein Suite"*. It is a symphony, but not for a full orchestra, only for a string orchestra (with soloists). I decided to compose a piece like that myself. The first and third movements are in a more upbeat tempo and feature only the string orchestra. The second movement also features a choir without text and bells.
