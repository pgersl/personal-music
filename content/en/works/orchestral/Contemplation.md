# Program note

*Contemplation* is a quiet piece, but never passive. Strongly inspired by the music of Arvo Pärt, it explores the emotional and structural clarity found in his tintinnabuli technique. Simple, choral-like melodies drift slowly, surrounded by harmonies that seem both inevitable and uncertain. The effect is both spacious and focused—an invitation to listen inward as much as outward.

The piece is built around a tension between major and minor, light and shadow. This tonal ambiguity becomes more than a musical device—it mirrors a broader duality: the interplay between the ancient and the modern, tradition and abstraction. That conflict is never fully resolved; instead, it is held delicately in place, forming the emotional backbone of the work.

Despite its minimalist appearance, *Contemplation* is meticulous in its construction. Every pause, every interval, every shift in harmony is purposeful. Time slows, and the listener is given space to reflect—not just on the notes, but on the silence that surrounds them. This is music that resists urgency, instead offering a sense of still motion—unfolding gradually, like thought itself.
