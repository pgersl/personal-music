My name is Petr Geršl (b. 2005). I am an amateur composer and a classical music nerd. My oeuvre is composed of many styles of music-making. Right now, it has a few pieces for modern/electronic ensembles, solo piano pieces and large orchestral works, including three symphonies.

I am mostly self-taught in musical composition, mainly by reading orchestral scores and playing the piano. I started composing when I was 15 and had some free time on my hands. My earliest compositions didn't survive, all of them were for solo piano. Recently, I started working with more traditional ensembles.

The recordings you'll find here are not professional. I use [Musescore](https://musescore.org/) to write my music down and the audio here is exported from this program.
