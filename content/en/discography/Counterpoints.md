# Notes
Piano Counterpoint by Steve Reich (or Six Pianos) was one of the first pieces by Steve Reich I ever heard. Once I heard it, I was hooked on the sound of several pianos playing together. Of course, I heard the four-hand piano, even played it, or double piano pieces, but I have never heard SIX pianos all playing together. I decided to create something like that on my own. Steve Reich stopped at number one, I needed to create more.

My four counterpoints are all in very different styles. Nos. 1 and 2 are in the style of Steve Reich himself, although, I don't think I managed to capture his style as accurately as I thought. No. 3 is an attempt at capturing the style of John Adams (notice the harmony is very similar to *Hallelujah Junction*). No. 4 is I think a successful attempt at capturing the style of David Borden (mainly his *The Continuing Story of Counterpoint*).
