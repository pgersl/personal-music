# Notes
Counterpointing is my first piece not exclusively for the piano. I composed it a few years ago. Originally, it was supposed to be a little longer and there should have been a closing for the piece. However, I abandoned it and never returned to it and trying to do so now wouldn't be productive, because my style has changed a lot. The piece thus remains unfinished. There are no themes to speak of, though, so it doesn't even really feel like one piece.

I used Counterpointing when I was working to zone out and fully concentrate. It did help at that time but nowadays, I prefer silence or some of my newer pieces. Maybe you'll have a different experience listening to this piece. Enjoy!
