# Notes

*Explorations* is an album of study pieces in which I experimented with a variety of musical styles, ranging from bombastic orchestral textures to big band sounds. These compositions represent another important step in my development as a composer, as they allowed me to prove to myself that I could write music far removed from minimalism—pieces rich in texture, harmony, and, above all, melodic content. Each work in this collection was an opportunity to explore new ideas, techniques, and expressive possibilities, expanding the scope of my musical voice.
