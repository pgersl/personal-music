# Notes

Works of Evil is an album containing only two pieces. Music for Piano, Voices, and Orchestra is dedicated to the victims of the tragic shooting at the Faculty of Philosophy in Prague just before Christmas 2023. The Third Symphony is dedicated to the victims of Auschwitz. I consider these compositions to confront and reflect pure evil, which is the inspiration behind the title of the album. Both works are intended as a solemn remembrance, confronting humanity with the darkest aspects of our history and present.
