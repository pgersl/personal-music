# Notes

*Etudes in Minimalism* is one of my most recent collections of minimal music. The set focuses primarily on string instruments, serving as a key stepping stone in my personal development as a composer. Several pieces in this collection mark my first experiments with larger ensembles, allowing me to explore texture, repetition, and gradual harmonic shifts in a more expansive musical space. The collection reflects my interest in the subtle interplay between simplicity and expression, and each etude aims to reveal depth within minimal material.
