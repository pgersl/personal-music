# Notes
Grindset has to be one of my favorite collections. Three pieces are on this album: C minor Madness, F you and In D (minor), all of them very repetitive and autistic. I used to listen to them a lot whilst working, it really helped with concentration. 

The title of this album is a meme itself, but the titles of the individual pieces are hilarious to me as well. C minor Madness is derived from Glass' *Mad Rush*, F you is just funny on its own (it's in F major/minor, what did you think the F stands for?) and In D (minor) is derived, of course, from what is sometimes considered the first minimalist composition *In C* by Terry Reily.

Although I haven't been listening to these pieces for quite a while, hearing them again just made me smile. I think they can still be used to grind to, so feel free to do so!
