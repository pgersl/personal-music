# Notes

*Farewell* is an album of my final minimal pieces, and I promised myself that I would not compose in this style again. It serves as my farewell to minimalism, and at the same time, it represents the culmination of my work in this genre. The pieces in this collection are where I feel I refined the techniques and stylistic nuances of my favorite icons—Glass, Reich, and Pärt—bringing their influences together with my own voice to create what I consider my definitive statement in minimal music.
